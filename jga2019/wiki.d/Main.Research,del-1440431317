In the first part of this note, we prove that every graph on {$m$} edges has boxicity {$O(sqrt{m log m})$}, which is asymptotically best possible. We use this result to study the connection between the boxicity of graphs and their Colin de Verdière invariant, which share many similarities. Known results concerning the two parameters suggest that for any graph $G$, the boxicity of {$G$} is at most the Colin de Verdière invariant of {$G$}, denoted by {$mu(G)$}. We observe that every graph {$G$} has boxicity {$O(mu(G)^4(log mu(G))^2)$}, while there are graphs {$G$} with boxicity {$Omega(mu(G) sqrt{log mu(G)})$}. In the second part of this note, we focus on graphs embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$}. We prove that these graphs have boxicity {$O(sqrt{g} log g)$}, while some of these graphs have boxicity {$Omega(sqrt{g log g})$}. This improves the previously best known upper and lower bounds. These results directly imply a nearly optimal bound on the dimension of the adjacency poset of graphs on surfaces. \\%0a\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05765|arXiv:1503.05765]]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>box%3c%3c%0a%25maroon%25The structure of graphs with Circular flow number 5 or more, and the complexity of their recognition problem%25%25 (with %25navy%25G.

Although infinitely many such snarks were presented eight years ago by Macajová and Raspaud, the variety of known methods to construct them and the structure of the obtained graphs were still rather limited. We start this article with an analysis of sets of flow values, which can be transferred through flow networks with the flow on each edge restricted to the open interval {$(1,4) mod 5$}. All these sets are symmetric unions of open integer intervals in the ring {$RR//5ZZ$}. We use the results to design an arsenal of methods for constructing snarks {$S$} with circular flow number {$phi_{c}(S)>=5$}. As one indication to the diversity and density of the obtained family of graphs, we show that it is sufficiently rich so that the corresponding recognition problem is NP-complete. \\%0a\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.037741|arXiv:1501.03774]]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>box%3c%3c%0a%25maroon%25Graphs with no induced five-vertex path or antipath%25%25 (with %25navy%25M.

Scott also conjectured that the same should hold if {$T$} is replaced by any graph {$H$}. Pawlik et al. recently constructed a family of triangle-free intersection graphs of segments in the plane with unbounded chromatic number (thereby disproving an old conjecture of Erdos).

In this paper, we study the construction of Pawlik et al. in more details to extract more counterexamples to Scott's conjecture. For example, we show that Scott's conjecture is false for any graph obtained from {$K_4$} by subdividing every edge at least once. We also prove that if {$G$} is a 2-connected multigraph with no vertex intersecting every cycle of {$G$}, then any graph obtained from {$G$} by subdividing every edge at least twice is a counterexample to Scott's conjecture.  \\%0a\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0338|arXiv:1406.0338]]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a%0a>>box%3c%3c%0a%25maroon%25Islands in graphs on surfaces%25%25 (with %25navy%25P.

In the first part of this note, we prove that every graph on {$m$} edges has boxicity {$O(sqrt{m log m})$}, which is asymptotically best possible. We use this result to study the connection between the boxicity of graphs and their Colin de Verdière invariant, which share many similarities. Known results concerning the two parameters suggest that for any graph $G$, the boxicity of {$G$} is at most the Colin de Verdière invariant of {$G$}, denoted by {$mu(G)$}. We observe that every graph {$G$} has boxicity {$O(mu(G)^4(log mu(G))^2)$}, while there are graphs {$G$} with boxicity {$Omega(mu(G) sqrt{log mu(G)})$}. In the second part of this note, we focus on graphs embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$}. We prove that these graphs have boxicity {$O(sqrt{g} log g)$}, while some of these graphs have boxicity {$Omega(sqrt{g log g})$}. This improves the previously best known upper and lower bounds. These results directly imply a nearly optimal bound on the dimension of the adjacency poset of graphs on surfaces. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05765|arXiv:1503.05765]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a

Let {$m_t$} be the supremum of all reals {$alpha %3c= 1$} such that for every cubic  bridgeless graph {$G$}, there exist {$t$} perfect matchings of {$G$} covering a fraction of at least {$alpha$} of the edges of {$G$}. It is known that the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture is equivalent to the statement that {$m_5=1$}, and implies that {$m_4=14//15$} and {$m_3=4//5$}. In the first part of this paper, we show that {$m_4=14//15$} implies {$m_3=4//5$}, and {$m_3=4//5$} implies the Fan-Raspaud conjecture, strengthening a recent result of Tang, Zhang, and Zhu. In the second part of the paper, we prove that for any {$2%3c= t %3c= 4$} and for any real {$tau$} lying in some appropriate interval, deciding whether a fraction of more than (resp. at least) {$tau$} of the edges of a given cubic bridgeless graph can be covered by {$t$} perfect matching is an NP-complete problem.

In this paper, we investigate the linear choosability for some families of graphs: graphs with small maximum degree, with given maximum average degree, outerplanar and planar graphs.

Although infinitely many such snarks were presented eight years ago by Macajová and Raspaud, the variety of known methods to construct them and the structure of the obtained graphs were still rather limited. We start this article with an analysis of sets of flow values, which can be transferred through flow networks with the flow on each edge restricted to the open interval {$(1,4) mod 5$}. All these sets are symmetric unions of open integer intervals in the ring {$RR//5ZZ$}. We use the results to design an arsenal of methods for constructing snarks {$S$} with circular flow number {$phi_{c}(S)>=5$}. As one indication to the diversity and density of the obtained family of graphs, we show that it is sufficiently rich so that the corresponding recognition problem is NP-complete. \\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25On cubic bridgeless graphs whose edge-set cannot be covered by four perfect matchings%25%25 (with %25navy%25G.

We also construct an infinite family {$cc F$} of snarks (cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs of girth at least five and chromatic index four) whose edge-set cannot be covered by 4 perfect matchings. Only two such graphs were known. It turns out that the family {$cc F$} also has interesting properties with respect to the shortest cycle cover problem. The shortest cycle cover of any cubic bridgeless graph with m edges has length at least {$4m//3$}, and we show that this inequality is strict for graphs of {$cc F$}.

This concept generalises the notion of colouring the square of graphs and of cyclic colouring of graphs embedded in a surface. We prove a general result for graphs embeddable in a fixed surface, which implies asymptotic versions of Wegner's and Borodin's Conjecture on the planar version of these two colourings. Using a recent approach of Havet et al., we reduce the problem to edge-colouring of multigraphs, and then use Kahn's result that the list chromatic index is close to the fractional chromatic index.\\%0a%3c Our results are based on a strong structural lemma for graphs embeddable in a fixed surface, which also implies that the size of a clique in the square of a graph of maximum degree {$Delta$} embeddable in some fixed surface is at most {$3 Delta //2$} plus a constant.\\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Locally identifying coloring of graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25S.

The least number of colors in a dynamic coloring of {$G$}, denoted by {$chi_2(G)$}, is called the ''dynamic chromatic number'' of {$G$}. The least integer {$k$}, such that if every vertex of {$G$} is assigned a list of {$k$} colors, then {$G$} has a proper (resp. dynamic) coloring in which every vertex receives a color from its own list, is called the ''choice number'' of {$G$}, denoted {$ch(G)$} (resp. the ''dynamic choice number'', denoted {$ch_2(G)$}).

In this short note we disprove this conjecture. We first give an example of a small planar bipartite graph {$G$} with {$ch(G)=chi_2(G)=3$} and {$ch_2(G)=4$}. Then, for any integer {$k>= 5$}, we construct a bipartite graph {$G_k$} such that {$ch(G_k)=chi_2(G_k)=3$} and {$ch_2(G) >= k$}.\\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Boxicity of graphs with bounded degree%25%25  \\%0a> ''European J.

We also prove that triangle-free planar graphs are adaptably 3-choosable and give negative results on planar graphs without 4-cycle, planar graphs without 5-cycle, and planar graphs without triangles at distance {$t$}, for any {$t>= 0$}.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c %25darkgreen%25Note that%25%25 [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2008.06.003|this paper]] %25darkgreen%25greatly simplifies some of our proofs and answers some of the questions we raised.%25%25\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://oc.inpg.fr/esperet/articles/RR-1442-08.pdf|pdf]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgt.20391 |doi:10.1002/jgt.20391]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Game colouring of the square of graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25X.

Using a linear time algorithm, we also prove that outerplanar graphs are {$(2,5)^{**}$}-choosable (i.e. they are acyclically 2-choosable with color classes of maximum degree five).

This concept generalises the notion of colouring the square of graphs and of cyclic colouring of graphs embedded in a surface. We prove a general result for graphs embeddable in a fixed surface, which implies asymptotic versions of Wegner's and Borodin's Conjecture on the planar version of these two colourings. Using a recent approach of Havet et al., we reduce the problem to edge-colouring of multigraphs, and then use Kahn's result that the list chromatic index is close to the fractional chromatic index.\\%0a%3c Our results are based on a strong structural lemma for graphs embeddable in a fixed surface, which also implies that the size of a clique in the square of a graph of maximum degree {$Delta$} embeddable in some fixed surface is at most {$3 Delta //2$} plus a constant.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1345|arXiv:0812.1345]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00493-013-2573-2 |doi:10.1007/s00493-013-2573-2]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Fire containment in planar graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25J. van den Heuvel%25%25, %25navy%25F.

At every time step, firefighters can protect up to {$k$} vertices, and then the fire spreads to all unprotected neighbours. The {$k$}-surviving rate {$rho_k(G)$} of {$G$} is the expectation of the proportion of vertices that can be saved from the fire, if the starting vertex of the fire is chosen uniformly at random. For a given class of graphs {$cc G$} we are interested in the minimum value {$k$} such that {$rho_k(G) >= epsilon$} for some constant {$epsilon >0$} and all {$G in cc G$} (i.e., such that linearly many vertices are expected to be saved in every graph from {$cc G$}).%0a%3c In this note, we prove that for planar graphs this minimum value is at most 4, and that it is precisely 2 for triangle-free planar graphs. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.3016|arXiv:1102.3016]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgt.21673 |doi:10.1002/jgt.21673]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Boxicity of graphs on surfaces%25%25 (with %25navy%25G.

This is best possible (the number of colors cannot be reduced and the dependence on the maximum degree cannot be avoided) and answers a question raised by Kleinberg, Motwani, Raghavan, and Venkatasubramanian in 1997.

A {$Sigma$}-coloring is a coloring of the elements of {$V$} so that vertices appearing together in some {$Sigma(v)$} receive pairwise distinct colors. An obvious lower bound for the minimum number of colors in such a coloring is the maximum size of a set {$Sigma(v)$}, denoted by {$rho(v)$}. In this paper we study graph classes {$cc F$} for which there is a function {$f$}, such that for any graph {$G in cc F$} and any {$Sigma$}, there is a {$Sigma$}-coloring using at most {$f(rho(Sigma))$} colors. It is proved that if such a function exists for a class {$cc F$}, then {$f$} can be taken to be a linear function. It is also shown that such classes are precisely the classes having bounded star chromatic number. We also investigate the list version and the clique version of this problem, and relate the existence of functions bounding those parameters to the recently introduced concepts of classes of bounded expansion and nowhere-dense classes. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3191|arXiv:1303.3191]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2013.09.002 |doi:10.1016/j.ejc.2013.09.002]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a---%0a> %0a> [[#papers]]%0a> %0a> !!Publications%0a> %0a> (:if false:)%0a> !!!accepted papers%0a> (:ifend:)%0a> %0a> !!!2014%0a> %0a> *[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6926|'''%25maroon%25On Cubic Bridgeless Graphs Whose Edge-Set Cannot be Covered by Four Perfect Matchings%25%25''']] (with %25navy%25G.
