According to the celebrated Four Color Theorem, planar graphs can be colored with at most 4 colors, and the proof gives a (sequential) quadratic algorithm finding such a coloring. A natural problem is to improve this complexity in the distributed setting. Using the fact that planar graphs contain linearly many vertices of degree at most 6, Goldberg, Plotkin, and Shannon obtained a deterministic distributed algorithm coloring n-vertex planar graphs with 7 colors in {$O(log n)$} rounds. Here, we show how to color planar graphs with 6 colors in polylog{$(n)$} rounds. Our algorithm indeed works more generally in the list-coloring setting and for sparse graphs (for such graphs we improve by at least one the number of colors resulting from an efficient algorithm of Barenboim and Elkin, at the expense of a slightly worst complexity). Our bounds on the number of colors turn out to be quite sharp in general. Among other results, we show that no distributed algorithm can color every {$n$}-vertex planar graph with 4 colors in {$o(n)$} rounds. \\%0a> \\%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05582|arXiv:1802.05582]]%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> %0a> >>box%3c%3c%0a> %25maroon%25Separation choosability and dense bipartite induced subgraphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25R.J.

The optimal list size such that a proper list colouring is always possible given this restriction, we call separation choosability. We show for bipartite graphs that separation choosability increases with (the logarithm of) the minimum degree. This strengthens results of Molloy and Thron and, partially, of Alon. One attempt to drop the bipartiteness assumption precipitates a natural class of Ramsey-type questions, of independent interest. For example, does every triangle-free graph of minimum degree {$d$} contain a bipartite induced subgraph of minimum degree {$Omega(log d)$} as {$d -> oo$}? \\%0a> \\%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03727|arXiv:1802.03727]]%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> %0a> >>box%3c%3c%0a> %25maroon%25Exact distance coloring in trees%25%25 (with %25navy%25N.

It was not known that the chromatic number of this graph grows with {$d$}. As a simple corollary of our result, we give a negative answer to a problem of van den Heuvel and Naserasr, asking whether there is a constant {$C$} such that for any odd integer {$d$}, any planar graph can be colored with at most {$C$} colors such that any pair of vertices at distance exactly {$d$} have distinct colors.

The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is {$(0,0,0,0)$}-colorable, and a classical result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall shows that every planar graph is {$(2,2,2)$}-colorable. In this paper, we extend both of these results to graphs on surfaces. Namely, we show that every graph embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g>0$} is {$(0,0,0,9g-4)$}-colorable and {$(2,2,9g-4)$}-colorable. Moreover, these graphs are also {$(0,0,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable and {$(2,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. We also prove that every triangle-free graph that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0, 0, O(g))$}-colorable. This is an extension of Grötzsch's Theorem, which states that triangle-free planar graphs are {$(0, 0, 0)$}-colorable. Finally, we prove that every graph of girth at least 7 that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0,O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. All these results are best possible in several ways as the girth condition is sharp, the constant maximum degrees cannot be improved, and the bounds on the maximum degrees depending on {$g$} are tight up to a constant multiplicative factor. \\%0a> \\%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02841|arXiv:1603.02841]]%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> !!!Accepted%0a> %0a> %0a> >>box%3c%3c%0a> %25maroon%25The width of quadrangulations of the projective plane%25%25 (with %25navy%25M.

We also show that {$G$} has face-width (equivalently, contains an odd cycle transversal of cardinality) at most {$1//4+sqrt{n-15//16}$}, which is a constant away from the optimal; we prove a lower bound of {$sqrt{n}$}.

In this note, we prove this conjecture when each vector contains at most two non-zero entries. As an application, we prove several results on flows in highly edge-connected graphs, extending known results. For instance, assume that {$p>= 3$} is a prime number and {$vec G$} is a directed, highly edge-connected graph in which each arc is given a list of two distinct values in {$bbb Z_p$}. Then {$vec G$} has a {$bbb Z_p$}-flow in which each arc is assigned a value of its own list.\\%0a> \\%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03366|arXiv:1701.03366]] %25rfloat%25[[ https://doi.org/10.1137/17M1113758 | doi:10.1137/17M1113758]]%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> %0a> >>box%3c%3c%0a> %25maroon%25Polynomial expansion and sublinear separators%25%25 (with %25navy%25J.F.

This notion can be viewed as a relaxed version of nowhere-zero flows, as it directly follows from old results of Jaeger that every cubic graph {$G$} with a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow has a {$lfloor r rfloor$}-weak bisection. In this paper we study problems related to the existence of {$k$}-weak bisections. We believe that every cubic graph which has a perfect matching, other than the Petersen graph, admits a 4-weak bisection and we present a family of cubic graphs with no perfect matching which do not admit such a bisection. The main result of this article is that every cubic graph admits a 5-weak bisection. When restricted to bridgeless graphs, that result would be a consequence of the assertion of the 5-flow Conjecture and as such it can be considered a (very small) step toward proving that assertion. However, the harder part of our proof focuses on graphs which do contain bridges. \\%0a> \\%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03500|arXiv:1504.03500]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgt.22118 | doi:10.1002/jgt.22118]]%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> %0a> >>box%3c%3c%0a> %25maroon%25Small feedback vertex sets in planar digraphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25L.

An obvious lower bound for the minimum number of colors in such a coloring is the maximum size of a set {$Sigma(v)$}, denoted by {$rho(Sigma)$}.

It is proved that if such a function exists for a class {$cc F$}, then {$f$} can be taken to be a linear function. It is also shown that such classes are precisely the classes having bounded star chromatic number. We also investigate the list version and the clique version of this problem, and relate the existence of functions bounding those parameters to the recently introduced concepts of classes of bounded expansion and nowhere-dense classes. \\%0a> \\%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3191|arXiv:1303.3191]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2013.09.002 |doi:10.1016/j.ejc.2013.09.002]]%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> !!!2013%0a> %0a> %0a> >>box%3c%3c%0a> %25maroon%25A unified approach to distance-two colouring of graphs on surfaces%25%25 (with %25navy%25O.

diff:1519845304:1518775270:=143c143,145%0a%3c A {$k$}-weak bisection of a cubic graph {$G$} is a partition of the vertex-set of {$G$} into two parts {$V_1$} and {$V_2$} of equal size, such that each connected component of the subgraph of {$G$} induced by {$V_i$} ({$i=1,2$}) is a tree of at most {$k−2$} vertices. This notion can be viewed as a relaxed version of nowhere-zero flows, as it directly follows from old results of Jaeger that every cubic graph {$G$} with a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow has a {$lfloor r rfloor$}-weak bisection. In this paper we study problems related to the existence of {$k$}-weak bisections. We believe that every cubic graph which has a perfect matching, other than the Petersen graph, admits a 4-weak bisection and we present a family of cubic graphs with no perfect matching which do not admit such a bisection. The main result of this article is that every cubic graph admits a 5-weak bisection. When restricted to bridgeless graphs, that result would be a consequence of the assertion of the 5-flow Conjecture and as such it can be considered a (very small) step toward proving that assertion. However, the harder part of our proof focuses on graphs which do contain bridges. \\%0a---%0a> We study the relations between circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flows in a cubic graph {$G=(V,E)$} and the existence of certain bisections (partitions into two subsets of the same cardinality) of the vertex set {$V$}. In particular, a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow in {$G$} implies the existence of a bisection, where every connected subgraph on {$r-1$} vertices intersects both parts of the bisection. This is related to a recent conjecture of Ban and Linial, stating that any cubic graph, other than the Petersen graph, admits a bisection, where the graph induced by each part of the bisection consists of connected components on at most two vertices. We disprove that conjecture, constructing%0a> an infinite family of counterexamples. Our counterexamples all contain bridges so the conjecture may still hold if restricted to 2-connected cubic graphs. On the positive side, we show that any cubic graph admits a bisection where the%0a> graph induced by each part consists of connected components on at most three vertices. \\%0a717,718c719%0a%3c * [[ http://mixing.coas.oregonstate.edu/links/latex_files/pgfuserguide.pdf | Pgf user guide (pdf) ]]%0a%3c * The current [[ https://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/category/weather-reports/ | weather]] on Mars%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a---%0a> * [[ http://mixing.coas.oregonstate.edu/links/latex_files/pgfuserguide.pdf | Pgf user guide (pdf) ]]%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a

According to the celebrated Four Color Theorem, planar graphs can be colored with at most 4 colors, and the proof gives a (sequential) quadratic algorithm finding such a coloring. A natural problem is to improve this complexity in the distributed setting. Using the fact that planar graphs contain linearly many vertices of degree at most 6, Goldberg, Plotkin, and Shannon obtained a deterministic distributed algorithm coloring n-vertex planar graphs with 7 colors in {$O(log n)$} rounds. Here, we show how to color planar graphs with 6 colors in polylog{$(n)$} rounds. Our algorithm indeed works more generally in the list-coloring setting and for sparse graphs (for such graphs we improve by at least one the number of colors resulting from an efficient algorithm of Barenboim and Elkin, at the expense of a slightly worst complexity). Our bounds on the number of colors turn out to be quite sharp in general. Among other results, we show that no distributed algorithm can color every {$n$}-vertex planar graph with 4 colors in {$o(n)$} rounds. \\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Exact distance coloring in trees%25%25 (with %25navy%25N.

We show for bipartite graphs that separation choosability increases with (the logarithm of) the minimum degree. This strengthens results of Molloy and Thron and, partially, of Alon. One attempt to drop the bipartiteness assumption precipitates a natural class of Ramsey-type questions, of independent interest.

In particular, a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow in {$G$} implies the existence of a bisection, where every connected subgraph on {$r-1$} vertices intersects both parts of the bisection. This is related to a recent conjecture of Ban and Linial, stating that any cubic graph, other than the Petersen graph, admits a bisection, where the graph induced by each part of the bisection consists of connected components on at most two vertices. We disprove that conjecture, constructing%0a%3c an infinite family of counterexamples. Our counterexamples all contain bridges so the conjecture may still hold if restricted to 2-connected cubic graphs. On the positive side, we show that any cubic graph admits a bisection where the%0a%3c graph induced by each part consists of connected components on at most three vertices. \\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Box representations of embedded graphs%25%25\\%0a> ''Discrete & Computational Geometry 57(3) (2017), 590-606.''%0a> %25rfloat%25(:toggle hide box41 show="+" hide="-" button=1:)%0a> >>id=box41 box%3c%3c%0a> A ''{$d$}-box'' is the cartesian product of {$d$} intervals of {$bbb R$} and a ''{$d$}-box representation'' of a graph {$G$} is a representation of {$G$} as the intersection graph of a set of {$d$}-boxes in {$bbb R^d$}.

A {$Sigma$}-coloring is a coloring of the elements of {$V$} so that vertices appearing together in some {$Sigma(v)$} receive pairwise distinct colors. An obvious lower bound for the minimum number of colors in such a coloring is the maximum size of a set {$Sigma(v)$}, denoted by {$rho(Sigma)$}. In this paper we study graph classes {$cc F$} for which there is a function {$f$}, such that for any graph {$G in cc F$} and any {$Sigma$}, there is a {$Sigma$}-coloring using at most {$f(rho(Sigma))$} colors. It is proved that if such a function exists for a class {$cc F$}, then {$f$} can be taken to be a linear function. It is also shown that such classes are precisely the classes having bounded star chromatic number. We also investigate the list version and the clique version of this problem, and relate the existence of functions bounding those parameters to the recently introduced concepts of classes of bounded expansion and nowhere-dense classes. \\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Fire containment in planar graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25J. van den Heuvel%25%25, %25navy%25F.

In this paper, we study the frugal chromatic number of planar graphs, planar graphs with large girth, and outerplanar graphs, and relate this parameter with several well-studied colourings, such as colouring of the square, cyclic colouring, and {$L(p,q)$}-labelling.

The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is {$(0,0,0,0)$}-colorable, and a classical result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall shows that every planar graph is {$(2,2,2)$}-colorable. In this paper, we extend both of these results to graphs on surfaces. Namely, we show that every graph embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g>0$} is {$(0,0,0,9g-4)$}-colorable and {$(2,2,9g-4)$}-colorable. Moreover, these graphs are also {$(0,0,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable and {$(2,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable.

In this paper, we study the same problem when pseudo-disks are replaced by a family {$cc F$} of pseudo-segments (a.k.a. strings) that do not cross. In other words, any two strings of {$cc F$} are only allowed to "touch" each other. Such a family is said to be {$k$}-touching if no point of the plane is contained in more than {$k$} elements of {$cc F$}. We give bounds on {$chi(cc F)$} as a function of {$k$}, and in particular we show that {$k$}-touching segments can be colored with {$k+5$} colors. This partially answers a question of Hliněný (1998) on the chromatic number of contact systems of strings. \\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25The structure of graphs with Circular flow number 5 or more, and the complexity of their recognition problem%25%25 (with %25navy%25G.

In this note, we prove this conjecture when each vector contains at most two non-zero entries. As an application, we prove several results on flows in highly edge-connected graphs, extending known results. For instance, assume that {$p>= 3$} is a prime number and {$vec G$} is a directed, highly edge-connected graph in which each arc is given a list of two distinct values in {$bbb Z_p$}. Then {$vec G$} has a {$bbb Z_p$}-flow in which each arc is assigned a value of its own list.\\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Coloring Jordan regions and curves%25%25 (with %25navy%25W.

When {$cc F$} is a set of pseudo-disks that may only intersect on their boundaries, and such that any point of the plane is contained in at most {$k$} pseudo-disks, it can be proven that {$chi(cc F)%3c= 3k//2 + o(k)$} since the problem is equivalent to cyclic coloring of plane graphs. In this paper, we study the same problem when pseudo-disks are replaced by a family {$cc F$} of pseudo-segments (a.k.a. strings) that do not cross. In other words, any two strings of {$cc F$} are only allowed to "touch" each other. Such a family is said to be {$k$}-touching if no point of the plane is contained in more than {$k$} elements of {$cc F$}. We give bounds on {$chi(cc F)$} as a function of {$k$}, and in particular we show that {$k$}-touching segments can be colored with {$k+5$} colors. This partially answers a question of Hliněný (1998) on the chromatic number of contact systems of strings. \\%0a100c101%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07716|arXiv:1509.07716]]%0a---%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03827|arXiv:1511.03827]]%0a104a106,115%0a> %25maroon%25The width of quadrangulations of the projective plane%25%25 (with %25navy%25M.

When {$cc F$} is a set of pseudo-disks that may only intersect on their boundaries, and such that any point of the plane is contained in at most {$k$} pseudo-disks, it can be proven that {$chi(cc F)%3c= 3k//2 + o(k)$} since the problem is equivalent to cyclic coloring of plane graphs. In this paper, we study the same problem when pseudo-disks are replaced by a family {$cc F$} of pseudo-segments (a.k.a. strings) that do not cross. In other words, any two strings of {$cc F$} are only allowed to "touch" each other. Such a family is said to be {$k$}-touching if no point of the plane is contained in more than {$k$} elements of {$cc F$}. We give bounds on {$chi(cc F)$} as a function of {$k$}, and in particular we show that {$k$}-touching segments can be colored with {$k+5$} colors.

The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is {$(0,0,0,0)$}-colorable, and a classical result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall shows that every planar graph is {$(2,2,2)$}-colorable. In this paper, we extend both of these results to graphs on surfaces. Namely, we show that every graph embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g>0$} is {$(0,0,0,9g-4)$}-colorable and {$(2,2,9g-4)$}-colorable. %0a%3c We also prove that every triangle-free graph that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0, 0, O(g))$}-colorable. This is an extension of Grötzsch's Theorem, which states that triangle-free planar graphs are {$(0, 0, 0)$}-colorable. Finally, we prove that every graph of girth at least 7 that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0,O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. All these results are best possible in several ways as the girth condition is sharp, the constant maximum degrees cannot be improved, and the bounds on the maximum degrees depending on {$g$} are tight up to a constant multiplicative factor. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02841|arXiv:1603.02841]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a

We also prove that if {$G$} is a 2-connected multigraph with no vertex intersecting every cycle of {$G$}, then any graph obtained from {$G$} by subdividing every edge at least twice is a counterexample to Scott's conjecture.  \\%0a113c108%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0871|arXiv:1410.0871]]%0a---%0a> [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0338|arXiv:1406.0338]]%0a114a110,113%0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> !!!Accepted papers%0a

It was proved by Thomassen in 1986 that every planar graph has a 3-box representation. In this paper we prove that every graph embedded in a fixed orientable surface, without short non-contractible cycles, has a 5-box representation. This directly implies that there is a function {$f$}, such that in every graph of genus {$g$}, a set of at most {$f(g)$} vertices can be removed so that the resulting graph has a 5-box representation. We show that such a function {$f$} can be made linear in {$g$}. Finally, we prove that for any proper minor-closed class {$cc F$}, there is a constant {$c(cc F)$} such that every graph of {$cc F$} without cycles of length less than {$c(cc F)$} has a 3-box%0a%3c representation, which is best possible.\\%0a---%0a> %25maroon%25Coloring non-crossing strings%25%25 (with %25navy%25D.

In particular, a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow in {$G$} implies the existence of a bisection, where every connected subgraph on {$r-1$} vertices intersects both parts of the bisection. This is related to a recent conjecture of Ban and Linial, stating that any cubic graph, other than the Petersen graph, admits a bisection, where the graph induced by each part of the bisection consists of connected components on at most two vertices. We disprove that conjecture, constructing%0a%3c an infinite family of counterexamples. Our counterexamples all contain bridges so the conjecture may still hold if restricted to 2-connected cubic graphs. On the positive side, we show that any cubic graph admits a bisection where the%0a%3c graph induced by each part consists of connected components on at most three vertices. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03500|arXiv:1504.03500]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a

Although infinitely many such snarks were presented eight years ago by Macajová and Raspaud, the variety of known methods to construct them and the structure of the obtained graphs were still rather limited. We start this article with an analysis of sets of flow values, which can be transferred through flow networks with the flow on each edge restricted to the open interval {$(1,4) mod 5$}. All these sets are symmetric unions of open integer intervals in the ring {$RR//5ZZ$}. We use the results to design an arsenal of methods for constructing snarks {$S$} with circular flow number {$phi_{c}(S)>=5$}. As one indication to the diversity and density of the obtained family of graphs, we show that it is sufficiently rich so that the corresponding recognition problem is NP-complete. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.037741|arXiv:1501.03774]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Graphs with no induced five-vertex path or antipath%25%25 (with %25navy%25M.

Pawlik et al. recently constructed a family of triangle-free intersection graphs of segments in the plane with unbounded chromatic number (thereby disproving an old conjecture of Erdos).

A {$Sigma$}-coloring is a coloring of the elements of {$V$} so that vertices appearing together in some {$Sigma(v)$} receive pairwise distinct colors. An obvious lower bound for the minimum number of colors in such a coloring is the maximum size of a set {$Sigma(v)$}, denoted by {$rho(v)$}. In this paper we study graph classes {$cc F$} for which there is a function {$f$}, such that for any graph {$G in cc F$} and any {$Sigma$}, there is a {$Sigma$}-coloring using at most {$f(rho(Sigma))$} colors. It is proved that if such a function exists for a class {$cc F$}, then {$f$} can be taken to be a linear function. It is also shown that such classes are precisely the classes having bounded star chromatic number. We also investigate the list version and the clique version of this problem, and relate the existence of functions bounding those parameters to the recently introduced concepts of classes of bounded expansion and nowhere-dense classes. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3191|arXiv:1303.3191]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2013.09.002 |doi:10.1016/j.ejc.2013.09.002]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!2013%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25A unified approach to distance-two colouring of graphs on surfaces%25%25 (with %25navy%25O.

This concept generalises the notion of colouring the square of graphs and of cyclic colouring of graphs embedded in a surface. We prove a general result for graphs embeddable in a fixed surface, which implies asymptotic versions of Wegner's and Borodin's Conjecture on the planar version of these two colourings. Using a recent approach of Havet et al., we reduce the problem to edge-colouring of multigraphs, and then use Kahn's result that the list chromatic index is close to the fractional chromatic index.\\%0a%3c Our results are based on a strong structural lemma for graphs embeddable in a fixed surface, which also implies that the size of a clique in the square of a graph of maximum degree {$Delta$} embeddable in some fixed surface is at most {$3 Delta //2$} plus a constant.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c %25darkgreen%25Note that the latest version does not only extend the result of the conference version to graphs embeddable on any given surface, it also fixes a number of problems in the original proof.
