If any point of the plane is contained in at most {$k$} elements of {$cc F$} (with {$k$} sufficiently large), then we show that the elements of {$cc F$} can be colored with at most {$k+1$} colors so that intersecting Jordan regions are assigned distinct colors. This is best possible and answers a question raised by Reed and Shepherd in 1996.

The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is {$(0,0,0,0)$}-colorable, and a classical result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall shows that every planar graph is {$(2,2,2)$}-colorable. In this paper, we extend both of these results to graphs on surfaces. Namely, we show that every graph embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g>0$} is {$(0,0,0,9g-4)$}-colorable and {$(2,2,9g-4)$}-colorable. Moreover, these graphs are also {$(0,0,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable and {$(2,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. We also prove that every triangle-free graph that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0, 0, O(g))$}-colorable. This is an extension of Grötzsch's Theorem, which states that triangle-free planar graphs are {$(0, 0, 0)$}-colorable. Finally, we prove that every graph of girth at least 7 that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0,O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. All these results are best possible in several ways as the girth condition is sharp, the constant maximum degrees cannot be improved, and the bounds on the maximum degrees depending on {$g$} are tight up to a constant multiplicative factor. \\%0a\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02841|arXiv:1603.02841]]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a%0a>>box%3c%3c%0a%25maroon%25The width of quadrangulations of the projective plane%25%25 (with %25navy%25M.

Let {$G$} be a non-bipartite quadrangulation of the projective plane on {$n$} vertices. Our result immediately implies that {$G$} has edge-width at most {$1//2+sqrt{2n-7//4}$}, which is sharp for infinitely many values of {$n$}. We also show that {$G$} has face-width (equivalently, contains an odd cycle transversal of cardinality) at most {$1//4+sqrt{n-15//16}$}, which is a constant away from the optimal; we prove a lower bound of {$sqrt{n}$}. Finally, we show that {$G$} has an odd cycle transversal of size at most {$sqrt{2 Delta n}$} inducing a single edge, where {$Delta$} is the maximum degree.

In this note, we prove this conjecture when each vector contains at most two non-zero entries. As an application, we prove several results on flows in highly edge-connected graphs, extending known results. For instance, assume that {$p>= 3$} is a prime number and {$vec G$} is a directed, highly edge-connected graph in which each arc is given a list of two distinct values in {$bbb Z_p$}. Then {$vec G$} has a {$bbb Z_p$}-flow in which each arc is assigned a value of its own list.\\%0a\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03366|arXiv:1701.03366]]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>box%3c%3c%0a%25maroon%25Flows and bisections in cubic graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25G.

In particular, a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow in {$G$} implies the existence of a bisection, where every connected subgraph on {$r-1$} vertices intersects both parts of the bisection. This is related to a recent conjecture of Ban and Linial, stating that any cubic graph, other than the Petersen graph, admits a bisection, where the graph induced by each part of the bisection consists of connected components on at most two vertices. We disprove that conjecture, constructing%0aan infinite family of counterexamples. Our counterexamples all contain bridges so the conjecture may still hold if restricted to 2-connected cubic graphs. On the positive side, we show that any cubic graph admits a bisection where the%0agraph induced by each part consists of connected components on at most three vertices. \\%0a\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03500|arXiv:1504.03500]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgt.22118 | doi:10.1002/jgt.22118]]%0a>>%3c%3c

This graph has clique number {$q+1$}, and the purpose of this short note is to prove that its chromatic number is {$\Theta(d  \log q//\log d)$}. It was not known that the chromatic number of this graph grows with {$d$}. As a simple corollary of our result, we give a negative answer to a problem of van den Heuvel and Naserasr, asking whether there is a constant {$C$} such that for any odd integer {$d$}, any planar graph can be colored with at most {$C$} colors such that any pair of vertices at distance exactly {$d$} have distinct colors. Finally, we study interval coloring of trees (where vertices at distance at least {$d$} and at most {$cd$}, for some real {$c>1$}, must be assigned distinct colors), giving a sharp upper bound in the case of bounded degree trees.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06047|arXiv:1703.06047]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Coloring Jordan regions and curves%25%25 (with %25navy%25W.

Consider a family {$cc F$} of Jordan regions whose interiors are pairwise disjoint, and such that any two Jordan regions intersect in at most one point. If any point of the plane is contained in at most {$k$} elements of {$cc F$} (with {$k$} sufficiently large), then we show that the elements of {$cc F$} can be colored with at most {$k+1$} colors so that intersecting Jordan regions are assigned distinct colors. This is best possible and answers a question raised by Reed and Shepherd in 1996. As a simple corollary, we also obtain a positive answer to a problem of Hliněný (1998) on the chromatic number of contact systems of strings.\\%0a%3c We also investigate the chromatic number of families of touching Jordan curves. This can be used to bound the ratio between the maximum number of vertex-disjoint directed cycles in a planar digraph, and its fractional counterpart.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08159|arXiv:1608.08159]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Improper coloring of graphs on surfaces%25%25 (with %25navy%25I.

The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is {$(0,0,0,0)$}-colorable, and a classical result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall shows that every planar graph is {$(2,2,2)$}-colorable. In this paper, we extend both of these results to graphs on surfaces. Namely, we show that every graph embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g>0$} is {$(0,0,0,9g-4)$}-colorable and {$(2,2,9g-4)$}-colorable. Moreover, these graphs are also {$(0,0,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable and {$(2,O(sqrt{g}),O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. We also prove that every triangle-free graph that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0, 0, O(g))$}-colorable. This is an extension of Grötzsch's Theorem, which states that triangle-free planar graphs are {$(0, 0, 0)$}-colorable. Finally, we prove that every graph of girth at least 7 that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus {$g$} is {$(0,O(sqrt{g}))$}-colorable. All these results are best possible in several ways as the girth condition is sharp, the constant maximum degrees cannot be improved, and the bounds on the maximum degrees depending on {$g$} are tight up to a constant multiplicative factor. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02841|arXiv:1603.02841]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25The width of quadrangulations of the projective plane%25%25 (with %25navy%25M.

Let {$G$} be a non-bipartite quadrangulation of the projective plane on {$n$} vertices. Our result immediately implies that {$G$} has edge-width at most {$1//2+sqrt{2n-7//4}$}, which is sharp for infinitely many values of {$n$}. We also show that {$G$} has face-width (equivalently, contains an odd cycle transversal of cardinality) at most {$1//4+sqrt{n-15//16}$}, which is a constant away from the optimal; we prove a lower bound of {$sqrt{n}$}. Finally, we show that {$G$} has an odd cycle transversal of size at most {$sqrt{2 Delta n}$} inducing a single edge, where {$Delta$} is the maximum degree. This last result partially answers a question of Nakamoto and Ozeki.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07716|arXiv:1509.07716]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Additive bases and flows in graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25R. de Joannis de Verclos%25%25, %25navy%25T.-N.

In this note, we prove this conjecture when each vector contains at most two non-zero entries. As an application, we prove several results on flows in highly edge-connected graphs, extending known results. For instance, assume that {$p>= 3$} is a prime number and {$vec G$} is a directed, highly edge-connected graph in which each arc is given a list of two distinct values in {$bbb Z_p$}. Then {$vec G$} has a {$bbb Z_p$}-flow in which each arc is assigned a value of its own list.\\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03366|arXiv:1701.03366]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c >>box%3c%3c%0a%3c %25maroon%25Flows and bisections in cubic graphs%25%25 (with %25navy%25G.

In particular, a circular nowhere-zero {$r$}-flow in {$G$} implies the existence of a bisection, where every connected subgraph on {$r-1$} vertices intersects both parts of the bisection. This is related to a recent conjecture of Ban and Linial, stating that any cubic graph, other than the Petersen graph, admits a bisection, where the graph induced by each part of the bisection consists of connected components on at most two vertices. We disprove that conjecture, constructing%0a%3c an infinite family of counterexamples. Our counterexamples all contain bridges so the conjecture may still hold if restricted to 2-connected cubic graphs. On the positive side, we show that any cubic graph admits a bisection where the%0a%3c graph induced by each part consists of connected components on at most three vertices. \\%0a%3c \\%0a%3c [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03500|arXiv:1504.03500]] %25rfloat%25[[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgt.22118 | doi:10.1002/jgt.22118]]%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
