text=This page gathers a certain number of (not very well known) problems I was interested in at some point. I would be curious to see proofs or counterexamples if you find some.%0a%0a!!%0a%0a!!Coloring graphs on surfaces such that every monochromatic component has bounded size (2014)%0a%0aWe proved in [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2475 |this paper]] that every graph of Euler genus {$g$} is 5-list-colorable in such a way that every monochromatic component has size {$O(g)$}. We conjectured that 5 can be replaced by 4 (this is known to be true for planar graphs, see [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2009.11.013 |this paper]]). A similar conjecture was made independently by Chappell and Gimbel for the chromatic number.\\%0a%0aWe also proved that graphs of Euler genus {$g$} and girth at least 6 are 2-list-colorable in such a way that every monochromatic component has size {$O(g)$}. We conjectured that it should also be true for graphs of girth 5. This is still open for planar graphs. A related problem was posed independently by Axenovich, Ueckerdt, and Weiner in [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02815 |this paper]]. \\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Equitable partition of planar graphs into 3 induced forests (2013, 2015)%0a%0aAn equitable partition of a graph {$G$} is a partition of the vertex-set of {$G$} such that the sizes of any two parts differ by at most one.%0a %0aIs it true that any planar graph has an equitable partition into 3 induced forests?\\%0a\\%0aIn [[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.disc.2015.03.019 |this paper]] we proved that for any {$k>=4$}, any planar graph has an equitable partition into {$k$} induced forests (this proved a conjecture formulated by Wu, Zhang, and Li in 2013).\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Coloring triangle-free planar graphs with bounded monochromatic components (2014)%0a%0aIn [[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0963548314000170 | this paper]] we proved that planar graphs with bounded maximum degree can be colored with 3 colors, in such way that every color class is the union of connected components of bounded size.\\%0aA natural question is the following:\\%0a\\%0aIs there a function {$f: NN rarr NN$} such that the vertices of every triangle-free planar graph with maximum degree {$Delta$} can be 2-colored in such a way that each monochromatic component has at most {$f(Delta)$} vertices?\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Two firefighters in planar graphs (2013)%0a%0aIn a graph {$G$}, a fire starts at some vertex. At every time step, firefighters can protect up to {$k$} vertices, and then the fire spreads to all unprotected neighbours. The {$k$}-surviving rate {$rho_k(G)$} of {$G$} is the expectation of the proportion of vertices that can be saved from the fire, if the starting vertex of the fire is chosen uniformly at random.\\%0aWe conjectured in [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgt.21673 | this paper]] that there is a constant {$epsilon>0$}, such that for any planar graph {$G$}, {$rho_2(G)>epsilon$} (i.e. two firefighters can save (in average) a constant proportion of the vertices of any planar graph). We proved the conjecture for triangle-free planar graphs and subsequently it was proved for any planar graphs without cycles of length {$i$} (for any fixed {$4 %3c=i%3c=7$}).\\%0a[[http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1158 | This paper ]] shows the following result: for any planar graph {$G$}, if 3 firefighters are available at the first round and then only 2 at each subsequent round, then a fraction of {$2//21$} of the vertices of {$G$} can be saved in average.\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Polynomial {$chi$}-boundedness (2012)%0a%0aWe say that a class of graphs {$cc F$} is {$chi$}-bounded if there is a function {$f$} such that for any graph {$G in cc F$}, {$chi(G) %3c= f(omega(G))$}, where {$chi(G)$} and {$omega(G)$} stand for the chromatic number and the clique number of {$G$}, respectively.\\%0aIs it true that if {$cc F$} is hereditary (i.e. closed under taking induced subgraphs), and {$chi$}-bounded, then there is a real {$c$} (depending on {$cc F$}) such that for any graph {$G in cc F$}, {$chi(G) %3c= omega(G)^c$}?\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Locally identifying coloring of chordal graphs (2012)%0a%0aLet {$N[u]$} denote the closed neighborhood of a vertex {$u$} (i.e. {$u$} together with its neighbors).\\%0aWe conjectured in [[ http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v19i2p40| this paper]] that every [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_graph | chordal graph]] with maximum clique size {$k$} can be properly colored with {$2k$} colors in such a way that for any two adjacent vertices {$u$} and {$v$} with {$N[u]!=N[v]$}, the set of colors appearing in {$N[u]$} is distinct from the set of colors appearing in {$N[v]$}.\\%0aWe proved the conjecture for several subclasses of chordal graphs: interval graphs, split graphs, and {$k$}-trees. Note that there are perfect graphs with clique number 3, requiring an arbitrary number of colors to make sure that for any two adjacent vertices {$u$} and {$v$} with {$N[u]!=N[v]$}, the set of colors appearing in {$N[u]$} is distinct from the set of colors appearing in {$N[v]$}.\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Constructive lower bounds for ayclic and star coloring%0a%0aA proper coloring of the vertices of a graph {$G$} is ''acyclic'' if every cycle of {$G$} contains at least 3 colors. It was proved by [[ http://www.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/Publications2/Acyclic%2520colouring%2520of%2520graphs.pdf | Alon, McDiarmid and Reed]] in 1991 that graphs with maximum degree {$Delta$} have an acyclic coloring with {$O(Delta^{4//3})$}. They also gave a simple probabilistic argument showing that there exist graphs with maximum degree {$Delta$} with no acyclic coloring with {$c Delta^{4//3}//(log Delta)^{1//3}$} colors, for some constant {$c$}.\\%0a%0aInterestingly, as far as I know, there is no deterministic construction of an infinite family of graphs with maximum degree {$Delta$} and with no acyclic coloring with {$c Delta$} colors, for some constant {$c>1$} (let alone with {$Delta^{1+epsilon}$} colors, for some constant {$epsilon>0$}). This is hard to believe.\\%0a\\%0a%0a!!Boxicity of graphs (and dimension of posets) of bounded maximum degree (1986, 1991, 2011)%0a%0aThis is probably the hardest problem on this page. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxicity | boxicity]] of a graph of maximum degree at most {$Delta$} is known to be {$O(Delta (log Delta)^2)$}, and there are examples showing that we cannot obtain better than {$Omega(Delta log Delta)$} (see [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2357 |this paper]]). What is the right bound? I tend to believe that the lower bound can be improved.\\%0a%0aThe same questions can be asked for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_dimension | dimension ]] of posets of height two whose comparability graphs have bounded degree (the two problems are almost equivalent, see [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2357 | this paper]]).\\%0a\\%0a%0a%0a!!Girth and density in hereditary classes (2009)%0a%0aThe ''girth'' of a graph {$G$} is the size of a smallest cycle of {$G$}, and the ''average degree'' of {$G$} is {$"ad"(G)= 2|E(G)|//|V(G)|$}.\\%0aLet {$cc F$} be a hereditary class of graphs (a class closed under taking induced subgraphs), and let {$cc "F"_g$} be the graphs of {$cc F$} of girth ast least {$g$}. I am interested in the following parameter: {$mu_{g}(cc F)="sup"_{G in cc "F"_g} "ad"(G)$}. It is well known that for the family {$cc P$} of planar graphs, {$mu_{g}(cc P)= {2g}/{g-2}$} (this mainly follows from Euler's Formula). More generally, a classical result of Gallucio, Goddyn and Hell implies that in any proper minor-closed family {$cc F$}, {$mu_{g}(cc F)$} exists and tends to 2 as {$g->oo$} (see also this [[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3142.pdf | recent paper]] for a generalisation). \\%0a%0aInterestingly, {$mu_{g}(cc F)$} is a rational number whenever {$cc F$} is the class of planar graphs, outerplanar graphs, partial 2-trees, but also the class SEG of intersection graphs of segments in the plane (when {$g>=5$}): it is not difficult to show that {$mu_{g}("SEG")= {2g-4}/{g-4}$} for any {$g>=5$}. But for the class CIRCLE of intersection graphs of the chords of a circle, things are quite different. We proved in [[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.disc.2008.04.054| this paper]] that {$mu_{g}("CIRCLE")= 2sqrt{{g-2}/{g-4}}$} for any {$g>=5$}.\\%0a%0aThis is fairly surprising and a bit mysterious. What other kind of function of {$g$} can you obtain? For instance, can you find a hereditary class {$cc F$} such that {$mu_{g}(cc F)=$} (some rational function of {$g)^{1//3}$}? Is it true that {$mu_{g}(cc F)$} is a rational function of {$g$} for graphs embeddable on a fixed surface? for any minor-closed class?\\%0a\\%0a%0a%0a!!Induced universal graphs for graphs with maximum degree at most two (2008)%0a%0a%0aLet {$F_n$} be the class of graphs on {$n$} vertices and maximum degree at most two. %0aWhat is the smallest number of vertices in a graph that contains all graphs of {$F_n$} as induced subgraphs?%0aIn [[ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2008.04.020 | this paper]], we proved that the answer lies somewhere between {$11 |__ n/6 __|$} and {$ 5 |__ n/2 __|+25 $}.
